# PyTorch_DeepLearning
Recognizing the pervasive adoption of PyTorch in industry giants such as Meta, Uber, Tesla, and OpenAI, I proactively undertook a comprehensive course by freeCodeCamp to align my skillset with the prevailing demands of the job market. <br>
The course covered topics like PyTorch Project Workflow, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Code Modularity, Transfer Learning and building Deep Learning models for custom tasks and datasets. <br>
Apart from the topics covered, the course also introduced Deep Learning experiment tracking using Tensorboard.
